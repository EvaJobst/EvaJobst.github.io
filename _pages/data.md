# Data Resources
In this place we collect all kinds of data we have processed/gathered (e.g. Research on Professors, Discussion with Editors, etc.)

## Findings of Early Research Stage
### Wikipedia Meetup
Our team went to the Wikipedia Meetup on 10/11/2019 in order to clarify some open questions and get to know the experts/editors.

##### Findings:
- **Requirements for Article:** For an article to be accepted the Professor should be ordentlich, because simply being an au√üerordentliche is not enough. Additionally, they should at least have published 4 books for the article to be accepted by them
- We need to have 4 different accounts, when we do the writing & corrections
- If the article isn't accepted we would still be able to check it in our profiles
- They invited us to the Wikidienstag Events, where they can provide us feedback; furthermore, we can visit them at their office whenever we have questions
- They provided us with an alternative (regiowiki.at), which has less strict criterias
- The rules for the english & german Wikipedia are different; for the english translation you need to wait longer for it to be accepted

### Online Research on Professors
In this step we have roughly analysed the available information of the professors online. Our goal was gaining a feeling on what kind of information we require for a Wikipedia article (we used the existing ones of TU professors as guideline) and what kind of information we find online (and what kind of information we can't find online). This knowledge will help us deciding on the first person we write an article on.
