# Data Resources
In this place we collect all kinds of data we have processed/gathered (e.g. Research on Professors, Discussion with Editors, etc.)

## Findings of Early Research Stage
### Wikipedia Meetup
Our team went to the Wikipedia Meetup on 10/11/2019 in order to clarify some open questions and get to know the experts/editors.

##### Findings:
- **Requirements for Article:** For an article to be accepted the Professor should be ordentlich, because simply being an außerordentliche is not enough. Additionally, they should at least have published 4 books for the article to be accepted by them
- We need to have 4 different accounts, when we do the writing & corrections
- If the article isn't accepted we would still be able to check it in our profiles
- They invited us to the Wikidienstag Events, where they can provide us feedback; furthermore, we can visit them at their office whenever we have questions
- They provided us with an alternative (regiowiki.at), which has less strict criterias
- The rules for the english & german Wikipedia are different; for the english translation you need to wait longer for it to be accepted

### Online Research on Professors
In this step we have roughly analysed the available information of the professors online. Our goal was gaining a feeling on what kind of information we require for a Wikipedia article (we used the existing ones of TU professors as guideline) and what kind of information we find online (and what kind of information we can't find online). This knowledge will help us deciding on the first person we write an article on.

### Contact with Professors
#### Geraldine Fitzpatrick
We contacted Geraldine Fitzpatrick via E-Mail providing her a complete draft-article written in Microsoft Word to see if our information about her is accurate and if she liked it. We didn't inform her beforehand thus surprised her with our intentions. She was very happy about us writing an article about her and helped us to correct things like the professors who guided her during her time at the hospital certifying as a midwife.
#### Margrit Gelautz
On 13.11.2019 we met Margit Gelautz and explained her our project and aim of the project and we asked her to participate. The article about Gelautz was finished on time and showed to the other team, however Margrit Gelautz wanted to meet us after the lecture on 11.12.2019. She explained us that she don't want the article to be published. We asked for her reason, but she just told us that she wants to postponed the publishing till summer semester. Told us that she is impressed, however she asked her wish to be respected.
#### Margit Pohl
We contacted Professor Margit Pohl informing her about our ambitions to create a Wikipedia article about her. We asked if there were any more information about her online. On 04.12.2019 she provided various web-links to useful source material and explained that the rest information is on the IGW TU Wien website.
