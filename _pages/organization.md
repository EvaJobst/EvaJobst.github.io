### Accomplishments
[09/12/2019] - Publishing article on Hilda Tellioğlu. Got marked as "Wikifizieren" (missing some quality requirements) just 6 minutes later 🥳

[06/12/2019] - The draft document on Hilda Tellioğlu is now finished and ready to be reviewed by our Gelautz-Team. It's current state can be seen here: [\[PDF\]](../../assets/Drafts/Hilda Tellioglu/Merged - Draft - Tellioglu.pdf) [\[ODT\]](../../assets/Drafts/Hilda Tellioglu/Merged - Draft - Tellioglu.odt)

[04/12/2019] - We contacted Professor Margit Pohl informing her about our ambitions to create a Wikipedia article about her. We asked if there were any more information about her online. She happily provided various web-links to useful source material and stated how thrilled she was about our project.

[03/12/2019] - Draft documents on Hilda Tellioğlu and Margit Gelautz are being created. A very early draft on Hilda Tellioğlu's research topics and publications can be seen here: [\[PDF\]](../../assets/Drafts/Hilda Tellioglu/Momo - Draft - Tellioglu.pdf) [\[ODT\]](../../assets/Drafts/Hilda Tellioglu/Momo - Draft - Tellioglu.odt)

[28/11/2019] - We successfully published our first article on Wikipedia and were able to see edits being made by different, well established Wiki-editors already. Link to the Wikipedia article: [''https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geraldine_Fitzpatrick''](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geraldine_Fitzpatrick)

[28/11/2019] - Geraldine responded with comments, corrections and additions to our draft and was pleased to see, that we were writing an article about her.

[25/11/2019] - We reached out to Geraldine Fitzpatrick, so we can get her opinion on the article.

[23/11/2019] - A draft on Geraldine Fitzpatrick is being created, the first version looks like this: [\[PDF\]](../../assets/Drafts/Geraldine Fitzpatrick/Momo - Draft - Fitzpatrick.pdf) [\[ODT\]](../../assets/Drafts/Geraldine Fitzpatrick/Momo - Draft - Fitzpatrick.odt).

[21/11/2019] - We now offer time-tables as "OpenOffice Calc" Documents to better track the time spent of individual members on various tasks. Also, we now provide various documents as PDF and OpenOffice documents for better accessibility.

[20/11/2019] - We gathered 3 online sources that contain information on Geraldine Fitzpatrick. Vasilena, Daniella and Momo will attempt to extract, translate and rewrite all relevant information until Saturday 23/11/2019. The Milestones will be updated accordingly.

[12/11/2019] - We have analysed the challenges of publishing articles to Wikipedia on academics; we have decided against using regiowiki and will shift our project-focus to the discussion with the editors regarding that matter.
