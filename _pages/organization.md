### Decision Log
[20/11/2019] - We gathered 3 online sources that contain information on Geraldine Fitzpatrick. Vasilena, Daniella and Momo will attempt to extract, translate and rewrite all relevant information until Saturday 23/11/2019. The Milestones will be updated accordingly.

[12/11/2019] - We have analysed the challenges of publishing articles to Wikipedia on academics; we have decided against using regiowiki and will shift our project-focus to the discussion with the editors regarding that matter
